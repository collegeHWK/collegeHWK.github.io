                    I, Hoh Wye Kin, would like to thank my supervisors, formerly Ms Mai and currently Ms Jaya, for
                    guiding and providing
                    feedback on various aspects of my final year project, "Of Lurkers and Curses". Additionally, I would
                    like to thank my
                    family, especially my mother, for supporting me throughout my whole college life. Without them, I
                    would never have succeeded.
                    I would also like to thank my intakemates for having to need to deal with my existence. Lastly, I
                    want to give a special
                    thanks to my friends outside of my college life. To Harraz and Heng, I will always feel like there
                    is a goal to reach while
                    within your presence and I will take my envy to push me forward. To Hau Jyet, whom I've always
                    believed to be my closest companion,
                    Thank you.
