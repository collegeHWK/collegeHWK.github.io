                    Final Verdict: League of Legends as a game is only priotised for the gameplay aspects. While there are stories around for users to
                    discover lore, it is not the main aspect of the game. However, it should also be noted that the gameplay may become
                    repetitive and it is advised to explore this game with friends.

                <h3>Fallout 4</h3>
                <p>
                    Fallout 4 is one of the games which I'm on the fence about. This game revolves around the Lone wanderer exploring
                    the remnants of Boston in a world ravaged by nuclear bombardment. Your goal is to find your son, who was taken from
                    the vault just when the bombs started to fall. However, you have the freedom to complete whatever goals or quests
                    that you want to do first. This first person shooter game also has a outpost system where you can create outposts
                    for survivors to join.

                    Final Verdict: The most prominant fallout game for me was Fallout: New Vegas. That game spoiled me with its
                    amazing story-telling and mechanics. Fallout4 on the other hand, does not have that feeling. However,
                    its gameplay has improved from updates to the engine used.

                <h3>Starcraft 2</h3>
                <p>
                    Starcraft 2 is a real-time strategic game invovling three different races. This game comprises of 3 sections:
                    The main campaign; The online PVP; and The custom games. The main campaign tells the story of the Terran, Zerg,
                    and Protoss race after the events of Starcraft: Broodwar. The online PVP involves player-versus-player gameplay
                    in which players pick a race and battle each other until one player remains. Lastly, the custom games involve
                    player-made arcade modes and the Co=op mission modes.

                    Final Verdict: Starcraft 2 hit the nail on many points for me. I was able to enjoy a good story in the campaign, and have
                    fun in arcade mode with friends. Starcraft 2 is a successful sequel to the original Starcraft game.
